    "This report showcases our results for sentiment analysis. We experimented different types of recurrent neural networks on this task: basic RNN, LSTM and GRU. We studied the effect of attention on these models as well as testing different word embeddings (GloVe, FastText and Word2Vec). Finally, document level embedding were also investigated (WME, Bert sentence, GloVe average and a task specific average)."

    "\n",
    "3 types of recurrent neural networks were tested: Base RNN, LSTM and GRUs. We also experimented with different hyperparameters: \n",
    "- The number of hidden layers: 1 or 2\n",
    "- The size of the hidden state: 100 or 300\n",
    "- The type of output layer after the main network: linear or MLP (for more details on the MLP, see models/RNN.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention\n",
    "We tested 2 types of attention based on scaled dot-product attention: \n",
    "- Last hidden layer attention: \n",
    "$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^\\top/\\sqrt n)V$ where V = K = output sequence and Q is the last hiddent state\n",

    "\n",
    "### Document level embeddings\n",
    "There numerous document level embeddings in the literature.\n",

    "- Task specific average: a sentece is encoded by the average of its word embeddings and the word embedding are trained from scratch for this task.\n",
    "- WME: Document embedding based on the distance (based on Word Mover Distance) between the document and randomly generated documents.\n",
    "- Sentence BERT: a pre-trained document level embedding based on BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the class from the document embedding, 2 types of model were tested: linear model and MLP."

Additionally, using a more complex model after the RNN may not force the RNN to learn a good representation of the sentence (not linearly separable)."

    "This table allowing to compare the results for all the hyper-parameters simultaneously corroborates what has been said previously. However, the effect of the number of layers is not much meaningfull: increasing from 1 to 2 sometimes increases the performance, sometimes decreases it.\n",
    "But this table brings new information: the best test accuracy, 0.88768, is reached by the GRU model, with linear layer, a hidden size of 100 and two layers. This configuration has also the fourth smallest loss, which upholds the qualification as the best in the table. Its number of steps is 5632, which is a quite decent amount. The minimal loss, 0.287417, is realized by a LSTM model, also linear with 100 features and 1 layer. The test accuracy is also the third better, thus making this combination of parameters a pretty good choice too. The number of steps reaches 6336 this time, meaning more computation time. Without distinguishing the model, the hyper parameters of those two combinations are the same.\n",

The worst accuracy, 0.49788, is the RNN linear with a size of 300 and 2 layers, tight to the same configuration with MLP instead of linear. The highest loss, 0.722325, is achieved with the linear RNN, with a size of 300 and 1 layer. An fact worth noticing on the RNN is that, depending on the hyper-parameters, the test loss can be higher than the test accuracy, making those situations useless. This worst accuracy has a normal number of steps but the worst loss has a high number of 7040 steps.\n",

In order to obtain the best results, the number of steps must thus be limited to stay close to the minimum loss for each. The minimal loss is seen to be achieved with LSTM, as said previously.

The mean used at the beginning ot the report thus hide some better results, but those are not significant. The accuracies of the LSTM and GRU model are at the opposite very tight around the mean, which was of 0.88.\n",
    "For the loss, the one of the RNN model is moderately spread, but the mean is high. The losses of LSTM and GRU are a bit more spread, still moderately, but have their mean around better values: 0.45 for GRU and 0.38 for LSTM. As mentionned in the previous section about the scatterplot, LSTM and GRU overlap a lot, while RNN barely overlaps with the two.\n",
    "The performances of LSTM and GRU are very close and this is visible here too. GRU reaches more often a better accuracy but LSTM can reach the same, while LSTM is also able to get a great part of its points in the smallest loss area. But the spread means that a small loss is not always guaranteed, leading to the configuration of hyper-parameters being even more important.\n"
