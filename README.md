# sentiment_analysis

Sentiment analysis project for Web and text analytics course

Implement an RNN with attention for sentiment analysis. As inspiration, refer to the study of Letarte et al. (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5429/) or that of Ambartsoumian & Popowich (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-6219/).
Experiments:

- Investigate the performance using LSTM vs. GRU
- Investigate the performance using various word embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText.
- Investigate the performance using document level embeddings. See Wu et al. (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1482/)
- Investigate the performance without attention
- (Report & interpret all scores)
